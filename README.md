If you have docker installed, you can run the following command to start the server:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

To start your Phoenix server locally, you need to have Elixir and Erlang installed. You can follow the instructions [here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
